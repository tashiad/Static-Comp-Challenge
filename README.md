## Challenges
Server was finicky at times. New animals would be added just fine sometimes and then not added a few minutes later, despite the server still running and no changes being made to the code. Since no errors were showing up in the console, I determined that this is likely a server connection issue and not so much an issue with the code itself.

## Future Improvements
Try to DRY up the CSS a bit more.
